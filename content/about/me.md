# Hi, I'm Robert!

Originally from Oklahoma City, I found my way to Atlanta in my early adult years and never looked back. While I wasn't born here, Atlanta is truly my home, and I've put down roots in the vibrant Southwest Atlanta community. Technology has been woven into my life from an early age - what started as childhood fascination with computers has evolved into both a lifelong passion and a rewarding career in technology leadership.

## Technology Journey
My love for technology began with a [Tandy TRS-80 CoCo 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer#Color_Computer_2_(1983%E2%80%931986)). I eagerly awaited each issue of [Rainbow Magazine](https://archive.org/details/rainbowmagazine), which fueled my passion for programming. Over the years, I've mastered multiple languages: BASIC, Assembly, C, C++, Pascal, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go. After starting with an [Intel 286 PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286) running [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS#MS-DOS_3.x), I discovered [Red Hat Linux 5.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux). I replaced [Windows 98](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98) and embraced the Linux ecosystem, never looking back.

## Professional Experience
Throughout my [career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertsigler/), I've specialized in Systems Engineering, working with Windows, UNIX, VMware ESX, and Linux. After earning my [Red Hat Performance Tuning](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcs-performance-tuning) certification, I transitioned into leadership roles managing cross-functional technology teams. Currently, I serve as Director of Product Technical Operations at CoverMyMeds, a McKesson company that revolutionizes medication access challenges for patients. In this role, I lead 24/7/365 frontline operations and ITSM practices, ensuring continuous service delivery and operational excellence.
